# csgo-autoexec

My personal autoexec.

## How to use 

1. go to your csgo cfg folder

    in my case:
```
    C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\cfg
```

2. open terminal in path

    in windows you can write cmd in path in explorer to open terminal with your csgo cfg path


3. curl autoexec.cfg from this repository

```
    curl -o autoexec.cfg https://raw.githubusercontent.com/s0er3n/csgo-autoexec/master/autoexec.cfg
```
